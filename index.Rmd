<br>

Each section is equipped with **5 buttons** which toggle the visibility of 
the items in such section.  
Every item has a **level** assigned between 1 and 5, depending on how
important such item's information is.  
**Level 1** corresponds to basic knowledge.  
**Level 5** corresponds to very useful (at least for me) tools which 
should, ideally, not be forgotten.  
The **greater** the item's _usefulness_, the **greater** its _level_.

Press the button _Level n_ to only show the 
items with level greater than or equal to _n_.

```{r, include=FALSE}

sass(sass_file('my-style.scss'), output='my-style.css')
